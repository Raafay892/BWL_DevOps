DevOps is an engineering culture that aims to unify development and operations in ways that lead to more efficient development. When done effectively, DevOps practices result in faster, more dependable software releases that are aligned to business operations1. Teams that adopt DevOps culture, practices, and tools become high-performing, building better products faster for greater customer satisfaction2.

Software development is the process of designing, creating, testing, and deploying software applications3. There are several software development lifecycle models, including Waterfall and Agile models. The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to software development that follows a strict order of phases1. The Agile model is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration3.

DevOpsDays is a worldwide series of technical conferences covering topics of software development, IT infrastructure operations, and the intersection between them4. Arrested DevOps is a podcast that helps you achieve understanding, develop good practices, and operate your team and organization for maximum DevOps awesomeness5.
