##Minimum Viable Product (MVP)## is a concept from Lean Startup that stresses the impact of learning in new product development. It is defined as that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort123.

##Test-Driven Development (TDD)## is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests only45Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that focuses on the behavior of the system46. The main difference between TDD and BDD is that TDD tests individual units of code while BDD tests how these units work together456.

##Why is TDD Important for DevOps?## TDD is important for DevOps because it helps to ensure that the code is of high quality and that it meets the requirements of the customer. It also helps to reduce the number of bugs in the code, which in turn reduces the amount of time and effort required to fix them5.

##Cloud Native Microservices## is an approach to building and running applications that exploits the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model. It is a way of designing and deploying applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.

##Designing for Failure## in DevOps is a practice that involves designing systems that can handle failure gracefully. It is important because it helps to ensure that the system remains available and responsive even in the face of unexpected failures.

##Taylorism## is a management theory that seeks to improve efficiency in the workplace by breaking down tasks into smaller, simpler components and optimizing each component separately. It is named after Frederick Winslow Taylor, who developed the theory in the early 20th century.
