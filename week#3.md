    What is required DevOps Behaviors?
    This point refers to the key behaviors and practices that are necessary for DevOps to be successful, such as collaboration, continuous improvement, automation, monitoring, and feedback.

    What is Infrastructure as Code and What are its Benefits?
    This point is about the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, rather than manual processes. The benefits of Infrastructure as Code include greater efficiency, consistency, and scalability.

    What is Continuous Integration? (Get a Good Conceptual Understanding of it)
    Continuous Integration is the practice of regularly merging code changes into a shared repository and then automatically building and testing the code to detect and resolve integration issues early in the development process.

    What is Continuous Delivery?
    Continuous Delivery is an extension of Continuous Integration that involves automating the entire software release process, from building and testing to deployment and production, to ensure that changes can be released quickly and reliably.

    What is the Difference Between DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering?
    This point highlights the differences between DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), which is an approach to IT operations that emphasizes reliability and scalability. While DevOps focuses on collaboration and automation across the entire software development lifecycle, SRE is more focused on ensuring the reliability and availability of production systems.

    What is the Organizational Impact of DevOps?
    This point examines how the adoption of DevOps can impact an organization, including changes to culture, processes, and tools, as well as improvements in efficiency, speed, and quality.

    What is Cloud Computing?
    Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including computing power, storage, and applications, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

    What are the Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing?
    This point describes the essential characteristics of Cloud Computing, including on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service.

    What are Cloud Deployment Models?
    Cloud Deployment Models refer to the ways in which cloud services can be deployed, including Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, and Multi-Cloud.

    Cloud Service Models and Their Benefits.
    This point outlines the different service models in Cloud Computing, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), as well as their benefits, such as cost savings, scalability, and flexibility.
